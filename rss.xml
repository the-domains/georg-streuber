            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>artistphoto Georg Streuber</h1><p>Georg Streuber began his vocal training under Sebastian Richter's and Regina Köhler's guidance in Chemnitz. He attended the Landesgymnasium für Musik Dresden as Prof. Matthias Weichert's student from 2005 to 2007 and took courses at the academy of music "Carl-Maria von Weber" in Dresden until 2013. In 2005 and 2007 he was the awardee of the German National Youth Competition „Jugend musiziert“. Furthermore, he convinced the audience at the Duschek-Competition of the Mozart Foundation in Prague. He came first in this competition in 2011 after already having shown his expertise in 2006 when he was the first international awardee. The first prize for Lied interpretation he gained in 2012 at the inernational Lions singing competition Gut Immling in bavaria. He attended master classes and workshops with Camilla Nylund, Martin Snell, Henry Didier, Gerold Huber, KS Magdalena Hajóssyová, Evelyn Herlitzius and Allison Oakes. Together with his duet partner Afra Su he did perform in successful Lied recitals in Cluj/Romania and Dresden/Germany. The intensive studies of Gustav Mahlers oevre in 2012 did end up in three remarkable concerts of pieces like "songs of a wayfarer" (Modena, teatro pavarotti, direttore d'orchestra: Andrea Barizza), Rueckert Lieder together with Prof. Christian Kluttig(Dresden) and "Lied von der Erde", version for chamber orchestra by A. Schoenberg(Dresden) In 2007 he performed as Papageno in Mozart‘s magic flute in Freiberg, Döbeln and Chemnitz. Moreover, he sang the part of Dr. Caius in „The merry wifes of Windsor“ during the opera festival in Bad Hersfeld, 2009, as well as the part of Mr. Winterbottom and Dr. Nischel in the premieres of „Dinner for one“ and Martin Hecker‘s „Der Narr im Waisenhaus“ in the following year at Semperoper Kleine Szene (Dresden). In 2011 he performed as Mandarin and Gaukler in Hans Gál‘s comic opera „Die heilige Ente“(the sacredduck) in Berlin, which combines several opera pieces. For gaining further ensemble skills he joined the RIAS chamber choir Berlin in 2011 for a half year lasting internship as well as he is member of the Bayreuther Festspielchor since 2012. At the moment he is guest soloist at the Theatre in Zwickau(germany) in two productions: "Almaviva" in the young peoples opera "Cherubino mischt sich ein" a version of "Nozze di Figaro"(2014) and as "zweiter Bruder/Unhold" in "Puss in boots" by César Cui(2015), 2nd man in "Kiss me Kate" by Cole Porter(2016</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/84eeebad96f75eb14dab2077114d14c0c18e61ce.jpg"></article>]]></description>
